# IMPORTANT NOTE
This is a forked version of Muqsits 'WorldStyler'. The only changes I have made is 

1) Fixing various deprecated lines
2) Adding shortcut commands such as //1 instead of //pos1, //rpl instead of //replace, etc.

I am officially archiving my fork as of March 15th 2021, but you can still get a copy from the links below. From what I understand, a far superior copy of WorldStyler is being made for PM4 anyway, so you'd be best off waiting for that.

# WorldStyler
Yet another World Editor plugin for PocketMine... except it's actually pretty fast!
